# Prompt Library

A curated collection of useful prompts for AI-assisted development in this workspace.

## Purpose

This library contains reusable prompts that have proven effective for:
- Code generation and refactoring
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Code review and quality assurance
- Documentation and explanation
- Architecture and design decisions
- Testing and validation

## Structure

Prompts are organized by category:
- **Development:** Code generation, implementation, and feature development
- **Debugging:** Error diagnosis, troubleshooting, and bug fixes
- **Refactoring:** Code improvement, optimization, and cleanup
- **Testing:** Test creation, test improvement, and test debugging
- **Documentation:** Code documentation, README updates, and explanations
- **Code Review:** Quality checks, best practices, and improvements
- **Architecture:** System design, patterns, and technical decisions
- **Workspace-Specific:** PRD creation, reviews, research documentation, and workspace workflows

## Usage

1. Browse prompts by category
2. Copy the prompt that matches your need
3. Customize with your specific context (file paths, feature names, etc.)
4. Use in your AI assistant (Cursor, ChatGPT, etc.)

## Contributing

When you discover a useful prompt:
1. Use the `template.md` as a starting point
2. Add it to the appropriate category
3. Include context about when to use it
4. Update this README if adding a new category

## Best Practices

- **Be specific:** Include file paths, component names, and relevant context
- **Provide examples:** Show what good output looks like
- **Include constraints:** Mention workspace rules, patterns, or limitations
- **Test prompts:** Verify they produce useful results before adding
- **Keep updated:** Remove outdated prompts, update as patterns evolve
