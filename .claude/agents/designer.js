/**
 * Designer Agent - General Purpose
 *
 * Invoke the designer agent for any UX question, design decision, accessibility guidance,
 * or user flow discussion. Unlike designer-review (which reviews files), this skill
 * is for interactive, conversational design assistance.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   /designer "How should the mobile navigation work for this app?"
 *   /designer "What's the best way to show loading states in a form?"
 *   /designer "Design a user onboarding flow for first-time users"
 */
