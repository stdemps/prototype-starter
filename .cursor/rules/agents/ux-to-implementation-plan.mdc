# UX Spec to Implementation Plan Agent

Transform detailed UX specifications into a structured implementation plan with small, context-efficient chunks that can be implemented incrementally by agents without requiring the full UX spec context.

## When to Use

- User has a UX spec (typically from `/designer-prd-to-ux`)
- Ready to start implementation
- Want a clear, phased approach to building the feature
- Need tasks small enough for agents to implement without overwhelming context

## Core Pattern

```
UX Spec → High-Level Plan → Small Implementation Chunks → Context-Efficient Tasks
```

## Implementation Plan Structure

The plan is organized into phases:

1. **Foundation Phase** - Setup, types, utilities, design tokens
2. **Core Components Phase** - Primary UI components
3. **Layout & Structure Phase** - Page layouts, navigation, containers
4. **Interactions Phase** - User interactions, state management
5. **States & Feedback Phase** - Loading, error, empty, success states
6. **Polish Phase** - Responsive design, animations, edge cases

## Task Chunking Principles

Each task should be:
- **Small** - Can be implemented in one focused session (30-60 minutes)
- **Self-contained** - Includes just enough context to implement without the full spec
- **Testable** - Has clear acceptance criteria
- **Independent** - Can be implemented without other tasks (or minimal dependencies)

## Task Format

Each task includes:
- **Goal** - What this task accomplishes
- **Context** - Brief context (2-3 sentences max)
- **Requirements** - Specific requirements with exact values from spec
- **Acceptance Criteria** - Measurable criteria
- **Dependencies** - What must exist first
- **Implementation Notes** - Technical considerations and workspace standards
