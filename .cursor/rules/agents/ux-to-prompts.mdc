# UX Spec to Build-Order Prompts Agent

Transform detailed UX specifications into a sequence of self-contained prompts optimized for UI generation tools. Each prompt builds one discrete feature/view with full context included.

## When to Use

- User has a UX spec (typically from `/prd-to-ux`)
- Output needs to feed into UI generation tools (v0, Bolt, Claude /frontend-design, etc.)
- User wants build-order sequencing (foundations → features → polish)
- Large specs that would overwhelm a single prompt

## Core Pattern

```
UX Spec → Extract Atomic Units → Sequence by Dependencies → Generate Self-Contained Prompts
```

## Build Order Strategy

Generate prompts in this order:

1. **Foundation** - Design tokens, shared types, base styles
2. **Layout Shell** - Page structure, navigation, panels
3. **Core Components** - Primary UI elements (nodes, cards, inputs)
4. **Interactions** - Drag-drop, connections, pickers
5. **States & Feedback** - Empty, loading, error, success states
6. **Polish** - Animations, responsive, edge cases

## Prompt Structure Template

Each generated prompt follows this structure:
- **Context** - What this feature is and where it fits
- **Requirements** - Specific behavior/appearance requirements
- **States** - All states from spec
- **Interactions** - How user interacts
- **Constraints** - Technical or design constraints

## Extraction Process

1. **Validate Input** - Confirm UX spec has all 6 passes and visual specifications
2. **Identify Atomic Units** - List discrete buildable features (screens, components, interactions)
3. **Map Dependencies** - Note what each unit requires
4. **Sequence by Dependency Graph** - Order units so dependencies come first
5. **Write Self-Contained Prompts** - Each prompt includes full context

## Self-Containment Rules

Each prompt MUST include:
- Enough context to understand the feature in isolation
- All visual specs (colors, spacing, dimensions) relevant to that feature
- All states that feature can be in
- All interactions for that feature

Each prompt MUST NOT:
- Reference "see previous prompt" or "as described earlier"
- Assume knowledge from other prompts
- Leave specs vague ("appropriate styling")

## Output Format

Write a markdown document to the same directory as the UX spec:
- If UX spec is `feature-x-ux-spec.md` → output `feature-x-build-prompts.md`
