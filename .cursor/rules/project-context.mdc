## Design & Development Standards

### CRITICAL: Mobile-First Requirement
This project uses **mobile-first responsive design** for ALL features. Before starting any UI work:
- ✅ Review the [Responsive Design Checklist](../checklists/responsive-design-checklist.md)
- ✅ Start with mobile layout (no breakpoint prefix)
- ✅ Enhance for larger screens with `md:` and `lg:` prefixes
- ❌ NEVER build desktop-first and retrofit mobile

**Why this matters:** Building desktop-first and retrofitting mobile leads to significant rework, inconsistent patterns, and poor mobile user experience. The responsive design checklist and updated guidelines prevent this from happening.
